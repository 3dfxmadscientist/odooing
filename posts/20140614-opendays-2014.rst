It's been a week now from this year's OpenDays.
It was an intense and action packed event.
Lot's of things could be learned from the talks,
but most important of all, it's great to meet in person
all these people we communicate with all the time.

The presentations are being uploaded to `Slideshare <http://www.slideshare.net/openobject>`_
and the the main theater talks were also recorded on `video <https://www.youtube.com/user/OpenERPonline>`_.
But you probably already know this, so maybe I could share something better:
the main messages I got regarding Odoo's strategy and direction.
