The news is out: **Odoo** is now the [new name for Openerp](https://www.odoo.com/blog/Odoo-Blog-1/post/Odoo-The-New-OpenERP-156).
Here you can see Xavier Pansaers in the OpenDays, putting the last stones on OpenERP an welcoming the new Odoo brand.

I figure this is a perfect time to renew the [OpenERP Management System blog](http://openerpmanagementsystem.blogspot.com).
So here it is: new name and new layout.

Keep following us and happy Odooing!
